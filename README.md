# Learning GPUs

This repository is my GPU learning. It runs on AWS g5.xlarge instances, which have NVIDIA A10G (Ampere architecture) GPUs, ~24GB VRAM.

## Setup

1. Install poetry: ```./poetry-install.sh```
2. cd into relevant directory: (e.g. ```cd cudnn/```)
3. Instead Python dependencies: ```poetry install```
